# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management process documentation. This folder contains comprehensive guides for understanding and implementing OctoAcme's project delivery methodology. Use this README as your navigation hub to explore our processes, roles, and best practices.

## OctoAcme Project Management Processes Overview

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative delivery approach grounded in five core principles: prioritizing customer value, delivering small testable increments, maintaining clear ownership, making data-informed decisions, and fostering psychological safety. The organization employs a defined five-phase project lifecycle—Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Close & Retrospective—supported by a cross-functional team structure that includes Project Managers (who coordinate delivery and manage risks), Product Managers (who define outcomes and prioritize the backlog), Developers, QA professionals, and Stakeholders. This role-based model ensures clear accountability and enables teams to move efficiently from problem statement through production deployment.

Project planning at OctoAcme emphasizes breaking work into shippable increments, identifying dependencies, and establishing shared Definition of Done criteria. Teams use standardized backlog item templates and risk registers to capture essential details such as acceptance criteria, estimates, and dependencies. Planning activities include kickoff meetings with stakeholders, creation of prioritized backlogs, estimation using T-shirt sizing or story points, and development of release plans with clear milestone maps. Risk and dependency management is integrated throughout, with teams capturing information in a centralized Risk Register that is reviewed and updated at weekly synchronization points.

Execution and quality assurance follow a structured daily rhythm and formalized workflows designed to maintain transparency and catch issues early. Daily standups focus on progress and blockers, while weekly delivery syncs showcase work and flagged risks; teams use project boards with defined columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) and enforce small pull requests with automated testing and code review requirements. Quality practices include unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI pipelines, and manual QA validation when needed. Metrics tracking—including velocity, burndown, and business success metrics—provides visibility into progress, with multi-level escalation paths (team, PM, Product Lead, Sponsor) for addressing blockers that impact delivery.

Communication and risk management are woven throughout OctoAcme's lifecycle via a consistent cadence of weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed. A standardized Risk Register tracks identified issues with impact assessments, ownership, and mitigation plans; Weekly Status Updates follow a template covering progress, next steps, risks, blockers, and decisions needed. Release readiness is ensured through pre-release checklists that verify acceptance criteria, CI/security scan passage, prepared release notes, and documented rollback plans. By combining structured planning, disciplined execution, proactive communication, and comprehensive quality controls, OctoAcme delivers reliable, customer-focused outcomes while maintaining alignment and learning across the organization.
